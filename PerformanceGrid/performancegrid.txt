Performance Grid Overview.

Porject will be using the MERN stack.


Basic user Sign-in/Registration page ('/') with validations.

From there they will be directed to the dashboard page. It will autopopulate with their last input or be blank for new users.
If they are returning the date of the last update will also be shown on the screen so they can compare.
*The exercises will have Link's that will take them to a page that describes the exercises/tests.

Once they enter their data they will be taken to their performance grid.This is where I will be out of my comfort zone and could use help.
I plan to take the data they entered and run it through an algorithm to come up with an index score.
Thise index scores will then be used in a radar/spider graph.
I also plan to have Link's that will take them to pages that will have information on how to improve their scores.

The page with the exercise/test descriptions will have basic descriptions and a link to a YouTube video for each exercise.

The performance recommendation page will have basic recommendations and a button to a page where they can purchase a specific program to help them.
